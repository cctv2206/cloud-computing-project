Just saw the movie Creed. @michaelb4jordan is such an incredible talent! Go see it!
I literally recommend everyone to see the movie creed
Creed Movie = classic .... Great movie.
@creedmovie Almost 4 decades of the #Rocky legend, #CREED is outstanding. CREED brought the thrills &amp; tears as did the first #ROCKY to us.
@KenJennings Did you consider structuring the joke with Creed first, then Brooklyn?  I wonder which order is funnier.
RT @Impsndcnma: Also just came back from CREED round 2. That movie is so good.
RT @dhm: Best part about seeing Creed in Philly is everyone cheering the final fight as if it were real. “GET UP!” everyone screamed.
The rewatchability of Creed is going to be very high.

But... Eh. Rocky is a great franchise, let's see how Creed is :)
Reviews were right, Creed is a DAMN good movie
Why didn't anyone tell me Fight Club was back in Assassin's Creed Syndicate...besides the obvious reason
MTV News have described Victor Frankenstein as a 'monster hit'. It's made $16mill so far. In comparison... Creed with $51mill.
Creed was an awesome movie!
I wonder how much weight Michael B. Jordan gained for Creed. Boy was cut!

Everybody should see creed just cause Michael b Jordan fine as hell

The person who made Assassin's Creed III put the ass into Assassin's Creed III. Terrible game. A whole £1.50 wasted.

RT @Jduh_Nicolle: I literally recommend everyone to see the movie creed
Love how the last fight in Creed took place in Everton's Goodison Park.

RT @lopez_abe_5: Creed is my new favorite movie
@StingerTail I'm glad you clarified. I wonder if Scott Stapp knows why Creed is trending.
Creed was good
It's me, the guy who hadn't pieced together that a boxing movie called Creed was a Rocky sequel
In a world of reboots and remakes, #Creed brings something new to the Rocky Universe and is worth your time. #GonnaSeeAgain
@ajapelian have u seen Creed tho
#Creed dam good movie!
Creed was so good!!
Creed was AMAZING
Creed is a GREAT movie but Cinderella man is better
@michaelb4jordan is amazing, Sly was amazing. Creed in itself was not just a great boxing or Rocky film but great stand alone movie.
Creed time
Max Payne 3, Far Cry 3 e Assassin's Creed Rogue pras férias. Agora só faltam elas chegarem.
However, I don't think Southpaw is better than Creed

All I have to say about #Creed is... 10/10
Judges, what is ur creed: Ours is not 2 reason why, ours is but 2 do or die? Hardcore about taking over juries? Throw your subj. judgments?
A great fighter once said. "It's not about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit, and get up, and keep going" #Creed
@AustinMahone  creed
The creed fight was better than the mayweather paqcuio fight
Creed was wonderful
Yo @ohheyhihello I got an assassin's creed mission labeled 101
Ok but why are you gonna watch Creed if you haven't seen any of the Rocky movies? I bet you won't get half of the references in the movie.
Creed is the best movie I have ever seen!!! It was basically a Rocky VII and I'm hoping for a Creed 2!!
@TSSCrew @djtrackstar heard he's pretty good in "Creed"

Creed has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a min
Creed was the best movie I've seen all year and a contender for best Rocky movie.
Ryan Coogler (director of Creed) might direct the Black Panther movie. Marvel does it again.
Creed 2 was unreal
how many jokes do you think have been made about creed the band when the movie comes up in conversation? 3-5 tops?
Go see Creed. It was AWESOME.
Damn Creed the band for ruining the movie title.

@CollegeGameDay dammit corso, you might have creed msu
Creed Creed Creed....
So #MichaelBJordan does #F4 U don't like it. He does #Creed he's ok. Real fans been riding since #wegoing2theship
So, the thing about CREED? All of the characters will make you want to cry. ALL of them.
Okay I have to watch #TheWiz tonight after I go see Creed.
Creed was an amazing film. Cant wait for a sequel.
Kesinlikle izleyin "Creed" Apollonun oğlu ve Rocky Balboa...
eu vou jogar assassins creed tres aaaaaaa
Going to recharge my inner fighter and see Creed. Lookout!
I want to see Creed tonight!
You can see that from how ACCEPTING we are of EVERYONE else, not matter there race, religion, creed or sexuality.
So that's why I wasn't Creed.
@F_uckYouSarai very.. it's pg 13.. but creed is good.
RT @JarodJoseph: So that's why I wasn't Creed.
@AatekarHardik Bhai.. The irony is 'Hindus' r Not united.. N call for building temples/Donations gets divided into caste/creed n politics.
Still waiting to see Creed...
Who wanna take me to see Creed and Hunger Games, I'm free till Tuesday, just tell me when
Might skip art basel and go watch Creed.
@ahrik93 @shynatown I might agree with her but I'll watch creed first before I decide
I wanna see creed today

After this meeting, I'll probably take a nap then go see "Creed"
I wanna see creed
But if we must have Oscar narratives: Creed is the kind of character piece with mass appeal Oscar used to love. Just like Rocky.
creed is such a good movie shjd
Creed is a great movie. Only complaint is during the training montage they didn't use the same music from Rocky IV.
@CastleMa he passed it. He was messin about in his lesson before and forgot the creed but I had him well drilled for the grading.
@Fabulousity201 yes! You should see both that and Creed
@iamchrisscott @1followernodad Yeah, but Creed? Is tha wise?
Creed looks amazing
@MatthewSamanskis creed really that good
Grappig, Hugo@RTL5 geeft een deja vu vanwege assassin's creed het station van London is goed gemodeleerd
@zzsmiller @FloWrestling I'd say short term the actor in Creed, though that can change by March.
Prejudice = Personal and INDIVIDUAL bias against any other person based on race, religion, creed etc..
I wanna go see Creed
I remember watching "Rocky" as a child &amp; being motivated by the movie. Watching Creed all these years later with my son was pretty special.
If the Academy were to give Creed some recognition it'd show they're "relevant" without having to chase massive CGI-soaked blockbusters.
Creed was a solid 10. Good movie.
RT @vmald63: Yo if you haven't watched Creed, WATCH IT.
@TThompsonYES is any of Bianca`s music on the Creed soundtrack...her(your) music was dope though
Ima go see Creed today by myself high af
@OldSchoolHeel_ I loved Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Assassin's Creed: Liberation.

Enjoyed watching #Creed.  Would have liked to have seen him win the fight. I loved the fact he didn't.  Kids could learn a lesson 4rm that
Outside of the fact that the rooks are useless to use Assassins Creed Syndicate is tons of fun!
Michael B Jordans acting in creed was actually horrible
@OnyxOblivion I was floored by Creed, I was expecting a nice feel good movie but it was more then that.
Who's down to go see Creed?
Love you PRINCESS @AdrianneArevalo  now lose the damn attitude before The making of CREED to occurs

In case you needed another reason to go see #CREED - You find out who won the famous behind-closed-doors 3rd fight between Rocky &amp; Apollo.
Not usually a fan of boxing movies cause they all have the same plot. But, you got to watch Creed.
Come to the SUB office 201 LaFun for the pre-show party for Creed! We have FREE donuts and hot chocolate, The Office on netflix, and trivia!

PREACHERS CREED.
Been playing Assassin's Creed: Syndicate and been having a blast. Great characters, great gameplay.
'Creed' has to rank with the best boxing films and probably the second best Rocky installment - really captures the sweet science!
Apparently shouting "If I fight, you fight!" really inspired people at the gym to give it their all so thanks Creed!
I just wanna see creed tho...but the movies ain't my fav place to go lol
Now playing: Creed - My Sacrifice
Still gotta see #Creed

So I'm in the room with a female boxer and of course we asked if she saw #CREED  ..of course and she met my boy @michaelb4jordan
But unbridled cheesiness is kinda one of the Rocky franchise's strengths, so Creed carried the torch very well.

Oh my god so when my dad and I saw Creed yesterday we were talking so much shit about the gods of egypt trailer because JFC what a wreck.
Also, reminder that the author of that WaPo Black Panther article also clowned Adonis Johnson character name from #Creed. So there's that.

#CREED is an amazing film and a fantastic example of the powerful, untold stories that emerge when voices of color get a chance to speak.

I have not seen Inside Out nor Mad Max.

@BlackGirlNerds @FilmFatale_NYC Wait. Creed was a black film? I thought it was a great film with great actors who happened to be black.

When u go watch Creed with friends and when the movie ends all of a sudden they become boxers
Absolutly loved #Creed Think it is my favourite movie of the year, so far!
Michael B. Jordan was great in Creed, but if u haven't seen him in Fruitvale Station you are missing one of the best roles u will ever see
I thought the last 45 mins was rather boring. The big fight scene wasn't dramatic at all. And not enough of Tessa Thompson. #Creed
I love the endings of the Assassins Creed games
There is literally no one here at the movie theather!! Hoping Creed is good!!
@michaelb4jordan Just watched Fruitvale Station for the first time and you were incredible man, super excited for Creed over in the UK!
@jimboch02 only if you write a follow-up about Creed's latest album is inspired by Rocky V
My prediction: Mcgregor kills Aldo in the ring. Apollo Creed style
Creed - with arms wide open #np &gt;&gt;&gt;

I wanna go see creed somebody take me!!
I need to watch Creed damn it
Watching Creed bout to pass out gotta clock that 12hrs tomorrow
I wanted to go see creed haven't got to see it yet
Do any of my followers have Assassin’s Creed Syndicate that could record me some ambient street noise? I would be very grateful!
So what's y'all take on the movie Creed?
If you think creed was bad you obviously aren't a meek mill fan and obviously have no love for a classic pump up movie. 12th round a classic
RT @_MereHef: I wanna see creed
RT @PrettiFuggnRaw_: Still need to see Creed and Chi-Raq.
Creed !!!
If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend going to see the movie "Creed" while its in theaters!
@adrifloridia YOU WATCHED CREED WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ROCKY? Oh the humanity.
Do yourselves a favor &amp; go see #Creed the movie, NOT the band. It holds it's own and is on par with Rocky 1 &amp; 2. Very impressed.
In the heart of the sea or creed?
RT @daniecal: Creed was really good.
Showy, less thoughtful soundtracks get more press, but Creed used music better than any movie I've seen this year
@VisionInATux Creed
Can't count hope many times I was called white for listening to Creed,  instead of just having a bad taste in music
@VisionInATux creed
Thoughts on #Creed #spoileralert
creed was awesome
Creed was so bomb to me
1. Great opening fight, was that ring the size of a king size bed though? #Creed.
@joshuaminnich @JakeBryantMan I think Creed is kinda pointless but I guess he has his moments
@VisionInATux Creed, IMO its like watching Mick train Rocky again.
the writing in assassin's creed syndicate is notably better than it's ever been. i just laughed out loud at a good jacob/evie moment.
@VisionInATux Creed, easy.
RT @TheRoar_24: Saw Creed again. Energizing film. Prediction: Someone in Hollywood is saying "ok, ok, hear me out.....Adonis Creed.....Vs..…
Just saw Creed. That movie is the truth
RT @gensaidso: Creed was such a good movie I wouldn't mind seeing it again
2. Pretty amazing scene when Creed Jr. was "fighting" his Dad via the projector and the YouTube video of Rocky vs Creed II. #Creed
@atulkasbekar @TheSlyStallone was sitting on the fence but WILL go and watch #CREED, my kids are big sly fans too, will take em along
RT @BatarangBlues: @VisionInATux Creed
@PeacockSoDope aw man. I can't answer right now. I've only watched Creed once. Watched SOC at least 5 times lol. What do you think?
RT @MartiBro14: @VisionInATux creed
RT @JasonRempala: @VisionInATux Creed, IMO its like watching Mick train Rocky again.
RT @_CuteOnPurpose: I wanna go see creed somebody take me!!
3. Avon Barksdale! #Creed. Even better that he is Duke's son.
RT @Ace_InkedUp: still haven't seen "Creed" yet
@OmniaMediaCo Creed. Such a suspenseful and intense movie allround #31DaysofOmnia
4. I'm going to try avoid Huxtable/Cosby jokes during this entire Twitter thread. #Creed
@QMcCall3 was right..I left Creed ready to fight. Someone put me in the ring!
RT @lauryn_winn: Just saw Creed and now I'm at the gym listening to the rocky theme
@Marc_Normandin To be fair, if you see Creed, all entrances are garbage compared to Pretty Ricky Conlan. Maybe they realized that.
I COULD WATCH CREED ON MY LAPTOP YAY
5. How did they know when a round ended? #Creed #RockyvsApollo3rdFight
my mom is listening to creed what the fuck
CREED IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE! IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?
I didn't see Creed yet.. Don't really think I want to.. Lol
6. Liev Schreiber could narrate anything. #Creed
Saw  "Creed" with the Old Skool Squad @josh_lametower @Shane_Gajewski
@shaneckel it blows my mind that the star of Creed is Wallace. #whereswallacestring
7. Mickey's Gym has cleaned up well over the years. #Creed
8. Creed Jr going to the club in a hoodie and sweats is about where the similarities between the two of us end. #Creed
i'm quite proud that the absolute worst assassin's creed game was developed in bulgaria
9. Rocky has been rocking a black hat that dominates all others for almost 40 freaking years. #Creed
on this assassins creed
@OnStr8BULLSshxt hard to say... What it comes down to is I know SOC is one of the best biopics to be made. Now is Creed one of the best...
@MrBrandonStroud but the end of the first one your supposed to cheer right? I grew up on 4, just saw Creed, so I'll claim ignorance
10. Rocky still wearing Adrian's old glasses is not doing himself any favors. #Creed
Creed was one of the best movies I seen all year real shit
The way creed is set up I just need somebody to sponsor me I swear I can be pound for pound the greatest fighter in the world #believeit
11. Oh fuck no, not another scene of Rocky at Adrian's grave. There were five too many of these scenes in #RockyBalboa. #Creed
RT @dexter412: @shaneckel it blows my mind that the star of Creed is Wallace. #whereswallacestring
12. Rocky reading the newspaper to Adrian and Paulie's grave is not the best part of this movie so far. #Creed
I wanna go see creed
Someone see Creed with me tomorrow
Someone get me Assassin's Creed Syndicate
13. Training scenes in Rocky movies complete me. #Creed. Rap music makes it even better.
Creed was good af
14. God damn the mirror scene is about as good as you get. How can I use Rocky's speech as a coach? #Creed
@ZaidJilani try assassins creed. Even longer and 1/10th as exciting.
15. I'm 45 minutes into the movie and love that I've only seen 30 seconds of actual live real fight scenes. #Creed
I wanna go see Creed
Still need to see Creed!!!
RT @got_em15mbrock: Still need to see Creed!!!
